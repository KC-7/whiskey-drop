# Whiskey Drop

[Whiskey Drop](https://kc-7.github.io/whiskey-drop/), my first Bootstrap project, is an online subscription service for whiskey enthusiasts. It offers a curated selection of whiskeys delivered monthly to subscribers. The website provides information on various whiskeys for a Whiskey Store.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML** - Structure of the website.
- **CSS** - Styling, utilizing the `style.css` file for custom styles.
- **Bootstrap** - Responsive design framework.
- **JavaScript** (not reviewed but typically involved with Bootstrap) - Interactive elements.
- **Font Awesome** - Iconography.
- **Google Fonts** - Typography.

## Installation

No installation is necessary for static sites, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The main entry point of the website.
- `css/` - Contains the CSS files for styling the website.
- `images/` - Directory for all the images used on the site.

## Features

- Information about whiskey subscription packages.
- User sign-up through a form for newsletter and subscription services.
- Site-wide sales and special offer alerts.

## Running the Site

Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the site. The site is not yet complete and some pages or links may lead to a 404 error, as the site was only designed to include the main page for now.

## Future Improvements

- Complete the site development, including the creation of 'About' and "Sign Up / Sign In" pages, which currently leads to a 404 error when accessed from the navigation bar.
- Improve mobile responsiveness on various devices.
- Enhance user interface and user experience design.
- Add more interactive elements with JavaScript to engage users.
